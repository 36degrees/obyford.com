Short one this week.

Last week was a week of two halves – found the first half tough, but the second was better.

End of year means it's time to ask those around me for feedback, and the first few bits have found their way to my inbox. Not for the first time, _delegation_ appears as a common theme in things to work on. I've just never been good at it.

Have bought a few books to read with the intention of trying to turn that around, but I also know the next couple of weeks are going to busy. We're preparing for our service assessment which is somehow a week next Thursday (how is it already March?).

Ironically, if I was better at delegating it would probably feel less intimidating. But hopefully I can pick this thread up again afterwards.

Outside of work, I've been:

- reading [The House in the Cerulean Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45047384-the-house-in-the-cerulean-sea) 📖
- watching [The Magicians](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4254242/) 📺
- eating [West African-style chicken peanut stew](https://realfood.tesco.com/recipes/west-african-style-chicken-peanut-stew.html) 🥣
- listening to ['Honey' by Gentleman's Dub Club](https://open.spotify.com/track/5CmWJMAGTOE16PKvxzYmLi?si=3hgoh1b3RQCOUxY1y27pIg) 🎧
- fussing our cats 😻
- trying to get out and enjoy some fresh air, and the early signs of spring ☀️
